## Project Details

### Description
This project utilises **Pytube** to download videos from Youtube while using **Tkinter** as the frontend layer for user interaction. Technically speaking, a GUI isn't required since Pytube alone would be sufficient in downloading videos from YouTube. However, it makes for a poor user experience without a UI. Hence, I decided to build an interface to improve usability.

### Libraries
1. Pytube
2. Tkinter

### Motivation
Currently, it is not possible to download videos from YouTube without first subscribing to YouTube Premium for a monthly fee. This is useful in situations where Wi-Fi or data isn't readily available such as on a flight. With this project, you can download videos from YouTube without having to through any third-party services.

### How to use
Simply download the files along with the necessary assets and run it using Python3. Make sure to store both the .py script and the assets in the same location for it to work. If it is working as intended, a GUI should appear.

### Limitations
1. .mp4 format only
2. Videos do not include captions
3. Rescaling the GUI window isn't possible

    - This YouTube video has helped me to establish an initial understanding of Pytube and Tkinter to kickstart the project. In order to introduce a little of my own personality, I tweaked and enhanced the code to include features which, in my opinion, would improve the user experience.
